<div class="emphasize">
  <h1 style="background-color:transparent;">Undergraduate Speakers</h1><br><br><br>
  <p>Undergraduate students from Oxford University will be giving accessible talks on something they're passionate about.<br>
These talks form the main part of the conference, and they're what IN[SCI]TE's all about.</p>
  <ul id="lightSlider" style="height:auto;">
    <li>
      <h3>Stephanie Lovell-Read</h3>
      <i>Drugging the epigenome: the therapeutic potential of bromodomain ligands</i>
      <p>Epigenetics, the chemistry that determines how the genetic code is used in cells, is at the heart of normal development and cell function. Significantly altered patterns of epigenetic modifications are a hallmark of many human disease states, including cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. Medical intervention at an epigenetic level – using drugs that target the proteins involved in epigenetic pathways – could therefore help us to better understand and treat illnesses which affect the lives of millions. In this talk, we’ll explore the therapeutic potential of targeting one class of epigenetic protein, the bromodomain-containing proteins, with small drug-like molecules.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Ana Sotirova</h3>
      <i>Bang! Bang! Bang!</i>
      <p>There has been a lot of fuss around the topic "The 4% Universe". But what are those 4%? Where are the other 96%? My talk will focus on what scientists know about the origin and current state of our universe and what is yet to be known. I will also explain what we mean by time and matter and hence whether the question "What was there before the Big Bang?" is reasonable. Furthermore, I will talk about current research projects in this field and why particle physics is actually necessary. Finally, I will briefly touch on how accelerators in CERN help us answer the above questions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Charig Yang</h3>
      <i>Crystal Growing: where Art meets Science</i>
      <p>Crystals are absolutely critical in the fields of science, but making them is an art. In this talk, we will explore the scientific concepts behind growing crystals, as well as some basic techniques on how to grow a nice one.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Alexandros Adamoulas</h3>
      <i>Should we continue with bioprospecting?</i>
      <p>An increasing human population and pathogenic resistance against current treatments call for a response from the field of drug discovery, with its rapidity not always being fast enough. Western science has thus chosen to probe the medical activities of indigenous human groups and their wilderness areas the world over in the hope that miracle cures for troublesome ailments can be found. However, this bioprospecting approach has not uncovered as many magic bullets as had surely been hoped. Alongside these mixed successes lie tales of traditional knowledge exploitation, continued habitat destruction and difficulties in allowing product harvesting on an industrial scale. This talk will analyse the pros and cons of bioprospecting and attempt to argue why, with the right regulations in place and with proper enforcement therein, bioprospecting should not be stopped.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Lauren Enright</h3>
      <i>A mathematical insight into virus evolution</i>
      <p>Can we use maths to solve the HIV pandemic?  Virus evolution is a balancing act between evolving within   the   hosts   body   and   evolving   at the   population   scale.  Unfortunately, for   viruses, reproducing very quickly within a host does not mean you’ll spread quickly through the population.  By mathematically modelling both selection pressures, we can try to understand the behaviour of viruses like HIV and predict the outcome of different treatments and measures. With the death toll of HIV in Africa expected to reach 90 million by 2025, these mathematical insights are vital for the future of human health.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Joshua Sauer</h3>
      <i>Changing the future landscape of medicine</i>
      <p>Being able to learn about critical drug targets is essential for the future of medicine. But, what if I told you that we can barely learn anything about 50% of current and essential drug targets? Bit of a problem, right? I will be talking today about how the work being carried out in my supervisor Dame Professor Carol Robinson’s group is supplying the pharmaceutical industry with the critical information it needs to develop the drugs for the future.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Alistair Swallow</h3>
      <i>Fractals, dimensions and infinity</i>
      <p>Fractals are objects which follow some sort of infinite repeating pattern. They have the property that the structure of a local area of the object exhibits the structure of the complete object. From a mathematical perspective, interesting geometric questions present themselves when studying fractals - What is the area of a fractal? Is its perimeter finite or infinite? How is it possible to define a non-integer dimension to a fractal? This talk will aim to answer some of these questions, while looking at some examples of fractals in nature (the snowflake being a famous one) and how fractals are being used in technology to make electrical components smaller.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Benjamin Singer</h3>
      <i>Eigenworms: The Mathematical Study of Animal Behaviour</i>
      <p>Scientists working in biomechanics believe that the tools of numerical measurement and algebra that have been used for centuries by physicists to describe movement, can now bring about a revolution in the study of biological locomotion today. The challenge is to figure out which numbers are important, and which aren't. In my talk, I will discuss the derivation and structure of the 'eigenworms' method for describing the shape and movement of the model organism C. elegans. I will then discuss the kind of insights that are available to us when we look at animal locomotion in this new mathematical light. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Dafydd Jones</h3>
      <i>Will main group chemistry help save the world?</i>
      <p>When talking about climate science and the environment one thing is often over-looked. Catalysis which as a field is vitally important in bringing about a greener and more sustainable future is dominated by transition metal catalysts which are expensive, toxic and are sourced through devastating mining operations. Modern main group chemists are looking to exploit cheaper, less toxic and the much more abundant elements of the main group to perform the same tasks. This has led to new and novel reactivity with applications beyond that of traditional transition metal catalysts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Nina Faure Beaulieu</h3>
      <i>Microplastics: not a micro-problem!</i>
      <p>Every year, 10 million tonnes of microplastics are released in the ocean and they have spread to ice caps, abyssal depths and throughout the entire water column. Unfortunately, plastic never disappears, it just gets smaller and smaller. Microplastics pose both (1) a physicalthreat by obstructing marine organism gut linings, affecting feeding behaviour, reducing reproductive output and (2) a chemical threat by sponging up toxic chemicals, some of which are cancer-causing substances, which are then ingested by marine life and subsequently us. In this talk I want to debunk the myths about microplastics, present the threats they can have on marine ecosystems, and raise public awareness of the solutions we can implement to tackle the microplastic problem. This requires us to change some preconceptions of what we sometimes consider at first glance to be pointless environmental solutions such as refusing a straw with drinks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>James Russell</h3>
      <i>Curing travel sickness with software</i>
      <p>Motion sickness affects one in three people across the world. In the UK alone, it's symptoms are felt by over 20 million individuals, and this makes travelling a miserable and unproductive experience. If just one in ten need to actually work while commuting, the time spent feeling nauseous costs Britain 4.7 billion pounds each year. Come and listen to my talk, where I will show you how software can be used to reduce the effects of travel sickness, and allow those who normally suffer to read and work in comfort while on the move.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Julia Dawson</h3>
      <i>What level of insight do stroke survivors have about their cognitive deficits?</i>
      <p>After an individual has had a stroke a small number suffer not only from language deficits, paralysis and other symptoms of stroke, but from lack of awareness of having these symptoms. They can be unaware that they can no longer walk, or be understood by others. This is a problem far more than simply denying they have problems, and can seriously affect their recovery since patients who don’t think have anything wrong with them tend not to seek treatment. This talk focuses on some of the unusual symptoms that can arise as a result of stroke, and how research on chronic patients tries to find out more about lack of awareness.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Patrick Taylor</h3>
      <i>The Science and Art of Porcelain</i>
      <p>How 18th century start-ups fused cutting edge technology with art to change the world forever. Background on the materials science of ceramics will also be given, as well as an introduction to the history of this artform from a scientist’s point of view.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Daniya Aynetdinova</h3>
      <i>Methods and challenges of Synthetic Organic Chemistry – designing a new approach to (-)-Sparteine</i>
      <p>I will discuss the challenges and methods of Synthetic Organic Chemistry using the knowledge and experience I obtained during a summer project. Introduction part of my talk will contain some scientific background on alkaloids and Sparteine in particular. I will briefly discuss why this compound is very important in Organic Synthesis and its applications in biology and medicine. The core part of my talk will be related to the synthetic transformations which were carried out during my project. I will pay attention on synthetic steps which produced interesting but unexpected results. The reactivity of complex molecules strongly depends on their structure and spatial conformation, so I will rationalize the results I got using 3D diagrams and animation.  My presentation will also include the brief overview of techniques used in Organic Chemistry research that I met and carried out myself during the internship.  The final part will be related to the future work and ideas around the Sparteine synthesis. Also, I will briefly talk about the most recent and important achievements in Synthetic organic chemistry and their impact on our lives.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Leander Thiele</h3>
      <i>A short derivation of Hawking radiation</i>
      <p>Hawking radiation is a phenomenon most people have heard about. Contrary to common belief, it is not at all an exotic process restricted to astrophysical black holes, but a very general phenomenon occurring at all kinds of horizons. I shall present a simplified derivation, making use only of basic quantum mechanics and some ideas from relativity. Furthermore, I will explore some consequences of the Hawking process, for example the recent observation of it in analogue systems and the basic ideas of Bekenstein entropy.</p>
