			<li>Give undergraduates the opportunity to attend; and the opportunity and resources to give a talk at a scientific conference.</li>
			<li>Introduce undergraduate scientists to existing interdisciplinary research projects and give them ideas and inspiration to come up with ideas of their own.</li>

		<h2>What will the talks be like?</h2>
			<p> Our student speakers are from all disciplines of science, they will talk about a project, internship, or piece of independent science research they've done, which will be presented at a level which allows students from other disciplines to easily understand.
All of our speakers are given a presentation skills workshop by the careers service to ensure they are well equipped to give a talk.  </p>
