    <h1 style="background-color:transparent;">Undergraduate Speakers</h1><br><br><br>
<p>
Over 30 undergraduate students from Oxford University will be giving accessible talks on something they're passionate about.<br>
These talks form the main part of the conference, and they're what IN[SCI]TE's all about.<br>
We will be constantly updating this list of talks:
</p>
    <ul id="lightSlider" style="height:auto;">
      <li>
          <h3>Patrick Taylor</h3>
          <i>Understanding the mechanics of dialysis - and how this can help patients.</i>
          <p>For patients whose kidneys have failed, dialysis does what a healthy kidney would normally do - it removes waste chemicals produced by the body from the bloodstream. In my talk I'll outline the physical mechanisms that enable this, how we might use this understanding to build a model of dialysis, and how such models could help us to make better dialysis machines, that will improve the lives of the two million people living with end stage renal disease (kidney failure) worldwide.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Jack Common</h3>
        <i>We're all naturalists: rediscovering the wonder in science
        </i>
        <p>Richard Feynman said, "the world is a dynamic mess of jiggling things, if you look at it right". His point echoes the sentiments of countless other scientists, philosophers and artists: the natural world is, at its core, strange and wonderful. But how do we look at it right? Through a diverse tour of various thinkers, from Ada Lovelace to Susan Sontag, I'll explore how the best science is most often driven by an almost childlike fascination with nature; why science education tends to erode that fascination; and why we need to reclaim it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Brittany Maxted</h3>
        <i>Quantum Quirks and Osprey Epiphanies:
          <br>When conservation meets the weird world of the subatomic.
        </i>
        <p>It's hard to imagine that conservationists could learn a lot from theoretical physicists. Yet the study of migratory birds has brought together these two seemingly incompatible subjects in the field of 'Quantum Biology'. Over the past year, I have been studying the behaviour of the European Osprey, a bird which migrates from Africa to Britain each summer to breed, returning - almost without fail - to their natal nesting sites. In this talk, I will discuss how behavioural and human influences have impacted upon the British Osprey population over the past century, and how quantum entanglement may be responsible for their incredible migratory tendencies.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Greg Hamilton</h3>
        <i>Tied Together: Unexpected Applications of Knot Theory
        </i>
        <p>Knots are as old as humankind, and only until recently has significant progress been made in understanding what makes knots, well, knots. As our knowledge has expanded, we've realized that knot theory delves into nearly every discipline of mathematics, and has yielded important contributions to physics, chemistry, computer science, and statistical analysis. What makes working in knot theory appealing is that it's easy to visualize and quite intuitive. This talk is to demonstrate the power of knot theory in application to various areas of science.
        </p>

      <li>
          <h3>Jameson Lee</h3>
        <i>Across the world in 90 minutes - the future of commercial aviation?
        </i>
        <p>The development and production of Concorde was arguably one of the greatest points of aerospace engineering. It is only one of 2 supersonic airliners or supersonic transport to enter service commercially, and did so for a period of 27 years. Before its first accident in 2000 (and even after), it had one of the best safety records of any other aircraft that has entered commercial service. The aircraft was retired from service in 2003 due to a recession of growth in the aviation industry, as well as the accident in 2000 and the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.  Will we see anything like it in the future?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Mahmoud Ghanem</h3>
        <i>Can Computers Be Creative? - What machines can teach us about being human
        </i>
        <p>Can computers be creative? Will they ever surprise us in new or interesting ways? Or are they destined to forever be nothing more than advanced calculators, shifting numbers around as they have been told to?
This talk will be a guided tour through a field which seeks to set computers free by elevating them to the status of creative agents. On the way I'll show you projects to make computers that can inspire us, argue with us, advise us, make us laugh and make us cry. I will also make the case for why Computational Creativity may well be one of the most important fields within AI research today.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Ciaran Gilbride</h3>
        <i>Rethinking Cancer: New approaches in oncology
        </i>
        <p>Cancer is a disease that permeates society, and is the second largest cause of death worldwide. Current treatments aren't perfect, and research is biased by fundraising, leading to huge discrepancies between survival rates in different cancers, like breast (78% 10 year survival) compared to lung cancer (5% 10 year survival), despite similar incidences. My talk discusses the optimism that new technologies and approaches can bring to oncology, and changes that can bring to how we treat cancer, on a personal level.
        </p>

      <li>
          <h3>Zo&euml; Clark</h3>
        <i>Harwell Science and Innovation Campus: thousands of scientists, unlimited potential.
        </i>
        <p>Ever wondered if it was actually possible to make a floating, frictionless train using superconductors? Or to deploy life-saving drugs through bubbles? Or to simulate the effects of radiation experienced thousands of miles in the sky? Thanks to Harwell Science and Innovation Campus all this and more is all possible. My talk will be about my time working in the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory at Harwell over last summer. I had the opportunity to work and interact with top scientists from many different disciplines whilst making parts for 'ZOOM', a new neutron scattering instrument being built at the campus.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Richard Grumitt</h3>

<i>The Probability of Everything
</i>
<p>How do we calculate the probability of a universe like our own existing? Our best idea for what was taking place in the early universe, inflation, yields an infinite set of possible universes i.e. a multiverse. Depending on the initial conditions, inflation can yield a universe with very different properties to our own. I will discuss what inflation is and how we can go about calculating the probability the process yields an observationally consistent universe. In particular, I will relate this to work I have carried out with David Sloan on multifield inflation and its probability measures.
</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Lewis Gaul</h3>

<i>Minesweeper in Python
</i>
<p>Computers are problem solvers - they are designed to perform any task we ask of them, and they do it with incredible efficiency. Technology has become extremely accessible with the increased usage of the internet - are you really making the most of it? Communicating with computers is easy - I will be demonstrating the simplicity of learning to speak their language (they have done their best to learn ours after all). My own minesweeper program will serve as an example of how to utilize your computer's true capabilities, from game design to calculating probabilities.
</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Chen Chen</h3>

<i>Machine calculate, Machine choose, Machine murder?
  <br>Crafting an algorithm for the value of life.
</i>
<p>Under what circumstances is it acceptable to kill one person in order to save five others? With technological progress, we are nearing a future where artificial intelligence will replace humans in performing what we consider to be cognitive tasks - a future that will force us to solve moral dilemmas that have remained unsolved for centuries. In this talk, I will consider the ethical, psychological, mathematical and legal attitudes to minimizing the loss of life, and how they may need to change in order to accommodate the advent of machine intelligence and creativity.
</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Eliza Casapopol</h3>

<i>Number theory and how to make a fortune
</i>
<p>Who needs a million dollars? What would you do to get them? Number Theory can be the answer! Some of the most creative ideas in maths appeared by looking at patterns and the best results came from team work. Let's discover some facts about the families of prime numbers, the thoughts provoked by a question written on the margin of a paper and why some mathematicians decided to spend time inventing a second proof.  Maybe your chance to become a millionaire is just one theorem away...
</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Christine Hirschberger</h3>
<i>Evolutionary development and the origin of novelty
</i>
<p>In my talk, I would like to explore a neo-Darwinian paradox: modern DNA sequencing has revealed that the huge diversity among all living things from plants to animals to microbes is not reflected on the genetic level. Especially genes involved in embryogenesis are pretty much universal, particularly in the animal kingdom. How then can the diversity in body plans that we see today be explained? While there is still a lot of work to do to answer this fundamental question, it now seems like changes in the genetic regulatory mechanisms that guide timing and localization of expression patterns during development play a key role, and this is what I would like to explain.
</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Matias Janvin</h3>
<i>A different take on buoyancy: why boats float from first principles
</i>
<p>Archimedes' principle says that the weight of a body immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. This classic result is often taught in introductory school-level science courses, but its conventional justification is nontrivial since it relies on the subtle concept of stress within a fluid, such as pressure. It will be shown that energy conservation can provide another route to this result, which adds a different perspective. By using thought experiments to consider which things can/cannot be consistent with energy conservation via a contradiction-style argument, we will derive Archimedes' principle in this new way.
</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Alexander Morch</h3>
<i>Astrobiology and the origin of life on Earth</i>
<p>Astrobiology is a newly emerging field of science centered on studying the premises for, the mechanisms behind and the consequences of life in space. It's highly interdisciplinary and stretches from rigorous science (astronomy, chemistry, geology, biology, etc.) to philosophical principles &amp; ethics.
The first half of this talk will be a brief introduction to the importance of astrobiology and its implications for humans. The last half will focus on a specific research project that links astrobiological phenomena to the origin of life on Earth - an event that is still shrouded in mystery some 4 billion years later.
</p>
      </li>

          <h3>Mark Hattersley</h3>

<i>Sport pundits or mathematicians, who knows best?<br>
  An investigation into team selection in cricket
</i>
<p>Sport pundits or mathematicians, who knows best? Can stats tell a manager who to put in their team? With cricket as a guiding example, I hope to answer these questions and give an insight into mathematical modelling of sport. This talk is about research I completed during my internship at ATASS Sports last summer. The focus is on integer optimisation for the selection of a Twenty20 cricket team. I recreate the methodology designed by GD Sharp et al. using the statistical software package R. I will then critically evaluate their approach, suggest potential improvements and consider further extensions of the model.
</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Phil Warren</h3>
<i>Why don't aeroplanes fall out of the sky when they're hit by lightning?</i>
<p>Commercial aircraft each get hit by lightning roughly once a year and yet the last lightning related incident was in 1967. This is made even more impressive when you consider that a bolt of lightning briefly creates as much power as the entire United Kingdom. My talk will be on my third year physics project, studying the movement interaction between aircraft and lightning, particularly the deflection of the aircraft skin around the point of contact. This was done by hitting a metal panel using a high power artificial lightning device and measuring how a reflected laser beam reacts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Michael De Lazzari</h3>

<i>A "Grey" Area:  Biological radiation damage, and current and future sources of concern.
</i>
<p>Everyone is constantly bombarded by radiation from both naturally occurring phenomena and human activities. How does this radiation damage tissue, and what are the long-term consequences of this exposure? In this talk, I will highlight where the common exposure sources come from, how different types of radiation interact with matter and cells in different ways, and how risk estimates are created from limited data. I will discuss why it is difficult to quantify this risk, and how this is important, with examples from air travel and body scanners, as well as future implications for deep-space missions and Mars colonisation.
</p>
      </li>
      <li><h3>Pau Ching Yap</h3>
<i>Reinforcement learning - Are you smarter than the machines?
</i>
<p>Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning which aims to train the machines to take actions on its own, without human interference in the decision-making process. Over the last few decades, reinforcement learning has gained its attention in the field of artificial intelligence. Along with various other computer science technologies, reinforcement learning has been applied to different fields such as game plays and robotics. The talk will begin by looking at the distinctive features of reinforcement learning. Some of the basic mechanisms will be introduced, before going into the findings in my research. We will see how the reinforcement learning control methods work in a simple toy model and a financial trading model.
</p>
      </li>
      <li><h3>Victor Ajuwon</h3>
<i>Biomimicry: the conscious emulation of life's genius.
</i>
<p>Life has been on this planet for 3.8 billion years; that's a long time to learn what works and what lasts. We have forgotten (or perhaps never learnt) that organisms have elegantly solved an uncountable number of challenges that we also face. At the core of Biomimicry is the understanding that the best ideas might not be our own. This opens us up to the wisdom of the natural world and gives us the chance to elucidate life's principles which can inform the way we build, generate energy, grow food and reduce waste. Life is evidence that a sustainable world already exists. Biomimicry is a science that aims to make that a reality for us as well, through innovations inspired by nature.
</p>
      </li><li><h3>Matt Robson</h3>
<i>How to Design a Racing Car - The Science of High Performance Materials
</i>
<p>Formula 1 is regarded by many as the ultimate test of car and driver. The cars are designed to be as fast as possible within the regulations, requiring highly specialised materials to withstand the intense forces, vibrations and high temperatures. Developments in nanomaterials, composites and advanced alloys have revolutionised motorsports technology in recent decades, making cars significantly safer, faster and more efficient. This talk covers specific examples, investigating carbon-fibre structures in the chassis and nickel superalloys for the exhaust manifold and connecting rod bolts.  Future developments in this field will most likely come from the exciting science of nanocomposites and potential applications will be discussed.
</p>
      </li><li><h3>Richard Ngo</h3>
<i>Clinical Trials in the 21st Century
</i>
<p>Where are we now, where are we going and why does it matter? In this talk I will be giving an outline of the global pharmaceutical industry, focusing on the extensive clinical trials which all new drugs must pass through. I'll look at how technology companies are pioneering long-overdue improvements in the way this crucial component of science works, based on my recent internship at clinical software company Medidata. Lastly, I'll explain why this field is one in which often over-hyped trends, like big data and wearable technology, are actually going to have a lasting impact on millions of lives, and what that future will look like.

<i>Helium atom microscopy: Imaging with neutral atoms
</i>
<p>As nanotechnology starts to feature in the world of electronics, the tools used for mass production of nanoscale devices will become increasingly important. Like any moving mechanical component, nanoscale tools suffer wear, which must be monitored. Whilst electron microscopy can image wear, the high-energy electron beam causes surface damage. Attention is turning to neutral Helium atom microscopy, but although imaging with neutral atoms doesn't cause damage, it provides unique challenges. How is a beam of neutral atoms brought to focus? How are the imaging atoms detected? Answering these questions will uncover this new technique and its future role in nanomanufacturing.

<i>Bats: Friends, Foes; Flight, Fight? A molecular perspective.
</i>
<p>Bats represent an order of 1200 species, all of which are flying mammals. Their significance was first spotted when SARS was traced back to the Chinese Horseshoe Bat, yet the bat was not 'infected' in any way and did not manifest any symptoms. Why is it that bats have evolved to 'coexist' with viruses and hence act as 'natural reservoirs'? What, then, are the implications of flight and evolution in this whole picture? I will take you through the current findings in questing the mystery of bats, as we discuss the intricacies of their immune system, genome repair and flight.

<i>Ancient brains: how new technologies reveal the secrets of prehistoric neural anatomy
</i>
<p>With the development of new 3D imaging technologies, virtual palaeontology has become a practical means of examining fossils which were previously too rare or too fragile to study. It is possible to use this new technology to examine the interior of fossils without destroying the specimen, something which was previously impossible with traditional techniques such as serial grinding tomography.
My project focussed on using Computed Tomography (CT) to study the crania of five fossil fishes, dating from the Early Triassic to the Early Cretaceous. Through examining the interior of the cranial cavity, I was able to infer things about brain morphology of these fish, something which provided insights into the evolutionary relationships of these fishes.

<i>X-ray Flares from the Nearest Supermassive Black Hole
</i>
<p>Have you ever wondered about all the stars in our sky and wondered what's in the centre of our Milky Way? No, not the fluffy chocolate, but a supermassive black hole called the Sagittarius A *, approximately 4.5 million times the mass of our sun. To learn more about this supermassive black hole, we looked at X-ray data from the Chandra CIAO observatory, NASA's X-ray telescope that allows us to learn more about very high energy regions of our universe.

<i>Bees: The Interdisciplinary Organism
</i>
<p>Bees matter. Beyond their obvious contributions to food production, they have provided invaluable insight into the evolution of social living, inspiration for AI systems, and the blueprints for the next generation of drones. The talk will look at the diversity of bees around the world and provide a whistle-stop tour of what bees can contribute to the different sciences.  Come along and find out why bees are so much more than honey.

<i>Do viruses understand us better than we understand ourselves?</i>
<p>Viruses can invade human cells, hijack our cellular machinery and turn our cells into factories to produce more virus particles. Some say viruses are the best biochemists we have: they understand us better than we understand ourselves. How do viruses manipulate our cells in order to stage this hostile takeover? During an 18-week research project, I investigated Vaccinia virus - best known as the vaccine that enabled the eradication of small-pox in the 1980s. My talk will focus on how investigating the interaction between Vaccinia virus and human cells can advance our understanding of viral infections in general.

<i>A Brief History of Cosmology: Discovering Our Place in the Universe
</i>
<p>Today we know that the universe started with the big bang around thirteen billion years ago, and has been expanding ever since, but our understanding has not always been so great. Since Eratosthenes discovered the earth was round in 240BC, we have been on a remarkable quest to find out the true nature of our universe. In the last one hundred years, increase in technology has led to discovery after discovery about the cosmos. My talk will follow the journey of how we came to know what we do, what our best scientific theories tell us about the cosmos today and where cosmology is taking us in the future.</p></li>

<i>Seeing the invisible: Tracking small biomolecules with a biophysical approach
</i>
<p>
How do we visualise a biomolecule that is invisible? The movement RNA is linked to animal development and human disease. However, tracking localisation of RNA is difficult as RNA itself is invisible.  The most widely used method is to couple RNA with a fluorophore which gives visible fluorescent light under fluorescence microscopy. In this talk, I will review the progress of fluorescence microscopy.  I will also discuss part of my final year project, which aims to improve fluorescence imaging of RNA by developing an assay which evaluates the use of fluorescent proteins in the study of RNA localisation.

<i>Active Matter: the Science of Swarms
</i>
<p>Active Matter is a new branch of physics and biophysics that seeks to describe large scale order in systems of living things. Examples of Active Matter range from schools of fish to cancerous cells. This field applies techniques and tools from more traditional physics to explore radically new problems. My talk will be an introduction to Active Matter, its history, and its future. Additionally, I will explain why certain tools from physics are well suited to study Active Matter (e.g. simulation) while others are not (e.g. statistical mechanics).</p></li>

<i>Creativity and Emotions: Investigating How Moods Affect Our Creative Output
</i>
<p>Is your productivity influenced by how you feel? Can you only work when you are in a certain mood? Do you think you produce your best work only under the 'right' conditions? My talk will focus on how mood states affect creative output. I will discuss the different relevant qualities of anger, sadness, happiness, and calmness. I will also describe possible effects of each of these moods on the number and kinds of ideas we generate. I will additionally compare the results of the different moods with each other. In particular. I will focus on a project I am working on for my honors thesis that tests recent mood and creativity theories.</p></li>

<i>Fruit Flies and Parkinson's Disease</i>
<p>How can we use insects to research Parkinson's (PD)? PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and is going to become more widespread as we live longer lives, but research into how to diagnose and treat it still has a long way to go. Over the summer last year, I worked on a project to prove that mutant flies could be used as test subjects to better understand the disease. My job was to produce evidence that this can be done by analyzing high speed video recordings of three different types of fruit flies while they were being fed.</p></li>
